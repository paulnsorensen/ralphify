# CLI Reference

!!! tldr "TL;DR"
    **`ralph run <path> -n 5`** runs the loop. **`ralph scaffold <name>`** creates a ralph from a template. Pass user args as `--name value` flags. Everything is configured in a single [`RALPH.md`](#ralphmd-format) file with YAML frontmatter.

## `ralph`

With no subcommand, prints the banner and help text.

```bash
ralph            # Show banner and help
ralph --version  # Show version
ralph --help     # Show help
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--version` | `-V` | Show version and exit |
| `--install-completion` | | Install tab completion for your current shell |
| `--show-completion` | | Print the completion script (for manual setup) |
| `--help` | | Show help and exit |

### Shell completion

```bash
ralph --install-completion bash   # or zsh, fish
```

Restart your shell after installing. Use `--show-completion` to print the script for manual setup.

---

## `ralph run`

Start the [autonomous coding loop](how-it-works.md).

```bash
ralph run my-ralph                         # Run forever (Ctrl+C to stop)
ralph run my-ralph -n 5                    # Run 5 iterations
ralph run my-ralph --stop-on-error         # Stop if agent exits non-zero or times out
ralph run my-ralph --delay 10              # Wait 10s between iterations
ralph run my-ralph --timeout 300           # Kill agent after 5 minutes per iteration
ralph run my-ralph --log-dir ralph_logs    # Save output to log files
ralph run my-ralph --dir ./src             # Pass user args to the ralph
```

| Argument / Option | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PATH` | | (required) | Path to a ralph directory containing `RALPH.md`, a direct path to a `RALPH.md` file, or the name of an installed ralph in `.agents/ralphs/` |
| `-n` | | unlimited | Max number of iterations |
| `--stop-on-error` | `-s` | off | Stop loop if agent exits non-zero or times out |
| `--delay` | `-d` | `0` | Seconds to wait between iterations |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | none | Max seconds per iteration |
| `--log-dir` | `-l` | none | Directory for iteration log files |

### User arguments

User arguments are passed as named flags after the ralph path. Use `{{ args.<name> }}` [placeholders](how-it-works.md#3-resolve-placeholders-with-command-output) in your RALPH.md to reference them.

Named flags (`--name value`) work without any frontmatter declaration. The `args` field is only required when you want to pass **positional** arguments — it tells ralphify which names to map them to:

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
args: [dir, focus]
---

Research the codebase at {{ args.dir }}.
Focus area: {{ args.focus }}
```

```bash
# Named flags (work with or without args declared in frontmatter)
ralph run research --dir ./my-project --focus "performance"

# Equals syntax works too
ralph run research --dir=./my-project --focus="performance"

# Positional args (requires args: [dir, focus] in frontmatter)
ralph run research ./my-project "performance"

# Mixed — positional args skip names already provided via flags
ralph run research --focus "performance" ./my-project
# dir="./my-project", focus="performance"

# -- ends flag parsing — everything after is positional
ralph run research -- --verbose ./src
# dir="--verbose", focus="./src"
```

Use `--` when a positional value starts with `--` and would otherwise be parsed as a flag.

Missing args resolve to an empty string.

### Stopping the loop

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the loop. Ralphify uses two-stage signal handling:

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` (first) | Finishes the current iteration gracefully, then stops the loop |
| `Ctrl+C` (second) | Force-kills the agent process and exits immediately |

The first press lets the agent complete its current work (e.g. finish a commit). If you don't want to wait, press `Ctrl+C` again to terminate immediately.

The loop also stops automatically when:

- All `-n` iterations have completed
- `--stop-on-error` is set and the agent exits non-zero or times out

### Peeking at live agent output

When you run `ralph run` in an interactive terminal, the agent's stdout and stderr stream live to the console by default. Press `p` to silence the stream (useful for quieter loops) and press `p` again to resume it. The default is off whenever the output is not a real terminal (piped, redirected, or captured in CI), so `ralph run ... | cat` is unaffected.

Live streaming works with line-buffered agents such as Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Aider, and any other process that writes one line at a time. For Claude running in stream-json mode you'll see the raw JSON events; for other agents you'll see the agent's plain output. Agents that repaint their own terminal UI (full-screen curses or TUI apps) are not supported — ralphify pipes their stdio, so they detect a non-TTY and fall back to plain output.

When `--log-dir` is set, output is captured to the log file and also echoed after each iteration completes; live peek still works the same way in that mode.

Some runtimes block-buffer their stdout when it is piped, which can make lines appear in bursts rather than as they are produced. If you notice stuttering, set `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (or the equivalent for your agent) in the environment where you launch `ralph`.

## `ralph scaffold`

Scaffold a new ralph with a ready-to-customize template.

```bash
ralph scaffold my-task      # Creates my-task/RALPH.md with a generic template
ralph scaffold              # Creates RALPH.md in the current directory
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[NAME]` | none | Directory name. If omitted, creates RALPH.md in the current directory |

The generated template includes an example command (`git-log`), an example arg (`focus`), and a prompt body with placeholders for both. Edit it, then run [`ralph run`](#ralph-run). See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for a full walkthrough.

Errors if `RALPH.md` already exists at the target location.

---

## RALPH.md format

The `RALPH.md` file is the single configuration and prompt file for a ralph. It uses YAML frontmatter for settings and the body for the prompt text.

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
commands:
  - name: tests
    run: uv run pytest -x
  - name: git-log
    run: git log --oneline -10
args: [dir, focus]
---

# Prompt body

{{ commands.tests }}

{{ commands.git-log }}

Your instructions here. Reference args with {{ args.dir }}.
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | yes | The full agent command to pipe the prompt to |
| `commands` | list | no | Commands to run each iteration (each has `name` and `run`) |
| `args` | list of strings | no | Declared argument names for user arguments. Letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores only. |
| `credit` | bool | no | Append co-author trailer instruction to prompt (default: `true`) |

### Commands

Each command has these fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | (required) | Identifier used in `{{ commands.<name> }}` placeholders. Letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores only. |
| `run` | string | (required) | Shell command to execute each iteration (supports `{{ args.<name> }}` placeholders). Commands starting with `./` run from the ralph directory; others run from the project root. |
| `timeout` | number | `60` | Max seconds before the command is killed |

Commands run in order. Output (stdout + stderr) is captured regardless of exit code. Commands are parsed with `shlex.split()` — no shell features (pipes, redirections, `&&`). For shell features, point the `run` field at a script. See the [Cookbook](cookbook.md) for real-world command patterns.

If a command exceeds its timeout, the process is killed and the captured output up to that point is used.

### Placeholders

| Syntax | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `{{ commands.<name> }}` | Output of the named command |
| `{{ args.<name> }}` | Value of the named user argument |
| `{{ ralph.name }}` | ralph directory name (e.g. `my-ralph`) |
| `{{ ralph.iteration }}` | Current iteration number (1-based) |
| `{{ ralph.max_iterations }}` | Total iterations if `-n` was set, empty otherwise |

`ralph.*` placeholders are automatically available — no frontmatter configuration needed.

Unmatched placeholders resolve to an empty string.
