# Writing Prompts

Your `RALPH.md` is the single most important file in a ralph loop. It defines the agent, the commands, and the prompt — everything the agent reads each iteration follows from what you write here. A good prompt turns an AI coding agent into a productive autonomous worker. A bad one produces noise.

This guide covers the patterns that work, the mistakes that waste iterations, and how to tune your prompt while the loop is running.

## The anatomy of a good RALPH.md

Every effective ralph has three parts in the prompt body:

### 1. Role and orientation

Tell the agent what it is, how it works, and where progress lives. This prevents the agent from trying to have a conversation, ask questions, or wait for input.

```markdown
You are an autonomous coding agent running in a loop. Each iteration
starts with a fresh context. Your progress lives in the code and git.
```

This framing matters because the agent has **no memory between iterations**. Without it, the agent may try to pick up where it "left off" or reference work it can't see.

### 2. Task source

Point the agent at something concrete to work on. The most common mistake is being vague ("improve the codebase"). Instead, give the agent a **specific place to look** for work:

| Pattern | When to use |
|---|---|
| `Read TODO.md and pick the top uncompleted task` | When you maintain a task list |
| `Read PLAN.md and implement the next step` | For sequential multi-step work |
| `Find the module with the lowest test coverage` | For coverage-driven testing |
| `Read the codebase and find the biggest documentation gap` | For open-ended improvement |
| `Fix the failing tests shown above` | When commands feed failures back |

The key is that the agent can **find work without you telling it what to do each time**. The task source is what makes the loop autonomous.

### 3. Rules and constraints

Constraints are more important than instructions. The agent knows how to code — what it doesn't know is your project's conventions, what to avoid, and when to stop.

```markdown
## Rules

- One task per iteration
- No placeholder code — full, working implementations only
- Run tests before committing
- Commit with a descriptive message like `feat: add X` or `fix: resolve Y`
- Do not modify existing tests to make them pass
```

## Using commands for dynamic data

Commands are what make the loop self-healing. Instead of static instructions, you inject live data into every iteration.

### Test feedback loop

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
commands:
  - name: tests
    run: uv run pytest -x
---

## Test results

{{ commands.tests }}

Fix any failing tests before starting new work.
Then read TODO.md and implement the next task.
```

The agent sees the current test results every iteration. If it broke something in the last iteration, the failure output is right there in the prompt.

### Multiple signals

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
commands:
  - name: tests
    run: uv run pytest -x
  - name: lint
    run: uv run ruff check .
  - name: git-log
    run: git log --oneline -10
  - name: coverage
    run: uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -q
---

## Recent commits

{{ commands.git-log }}

## Test results

{{ commands.tests }}

## Lint status

{{ commands.lint }}

## Coverage

{{ commands.coverage }}
```

Pick the 2-3 most useful signals. Don't dump everything — each command's output eats into the agent's context window.

## Patterns that work

### The TODO-driven loop

Maintain a `TODO.md` that the agent reads and updates each iteration.

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
commands:
  - name: tests
    run: uv run pytest -x
---

{{ commands.tests }}

Read TODO.md for the current task list. Pick the top uncompleted task,
implement it fully, then mark it done.

If tests are failing, fix them before starting new work.

## Rules

- One task per iteration
- No placeholder code — full implementations only
- Commit with a descriptive message
- Mark the completed task in TODO.md
```

**Why it works:** The agent always knows what to do next. You control priority by reordering the list. You can add tasks while the loop runs.

### The self-healing loop

Rely on command output to define "done" and let failures guide the agent.

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
commands:
  - name: tests
    run: uv run pytest -x
  - name: lint
    run: uv run ruff check .
  - name: typecheck
    run: uv run mypy src/
---

{{ commands.tests }}

{{ commands.lint }}

{{ commands.typecheck }}

Read PLAN.md and implement the next incomplete step. If any of the
commands above show failures, fix those first before moving on.

## Rules

- Fix command failures before starting new work
- One step per iteration
- Commit each completed step separately
```

**Why it works:** Failed commands automatically show their output. The agent sees exactly what broke and fixes it. You don't need to write error-handling instructions for every possible failure.

### The edit-while-running loop

The agent re-reads `RALPH.md` every iteration. You can steer the loop in real time.

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
---

You are an autonomous agent improving this project's documentation.

## Current focus

<!-- Edit this section while the loop runs to steer the agent -->
Focus on the API reference docs. Each endpoint needs a working
curl example and a description of the response format.

## Rules

- One page per iteration
- Verify all code examples run correctly
- Commit with `docs: ...` prefix
```

**Why it works:** When the agent does something you don't want, you add a constraint. When you want it to shift focus, you edit the "Current focus" section. The next iteration picks up your changes immediately.

### Parameterized ralphs

Use user arguments to make a ralph reusable across different projects or configurations:

```markdown
---
agent: claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions
args: [dir, focus]
---

Research the codebase at {{ args.dir }}.

Focus area: {{ args.focus }}

## Rules

- Read the code before making claims
- Cite specific file paths and line numbers
- Summarize findings in RESEARCH.md
```

Run the same ralph against different targets:

```bash
ralph run research -- --dir ./api --focus "error handling"
ralph run research -- --dir ./frontend --focus "state management"
```

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### Too vague

```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Improve the codebase. Make things better.
```

The agent doesn't know what "better" means to you. Always point at a concrete task source.

### Too many tasks per iteration

```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Implement user authentication, add rate limiting, write tests for
both, update the API docs, and deploy to staging.
```

One iteration = one task. If the agent tries to do five things, it'll do all of them poorly.

### No validation step

```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Read TODO.md, implement the next task, and commit.
```

Without "run tests before committing" or a test command, the agent will commit broken code. Always include validation, either in the prompt text or via commands.

### No commit instructions

```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Fix bugs from the issue tracker.
```

Ralphify doesn't commit for the agent — the agent must do it. Without explicit commit instructions, some agents won't commit at all, and progress is lost when the next iteration starts fresh.

## Tuning a running loop

The most powerful feature of ralph loops is that you can edit `RALPH.md` while the loop is running. Here's how to use this effectively:

**When the agent does something dumb, add a sign.** This is the core insight from the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). If the agent keeps deleting tests instead of fixing them:

```markdown
## Rules
- Do NOT delete or skip failing tests — fix the code instead
```

**When the agent gets stuck in a loop,** it's usually because the prompt is ambiguous about what to do when something fails. Add explicit fallback instructions:

```markdown
- If you can't fix a failing test after one attempt, move on to the next task
  and leave a TODO comment explaining the issue
```

**When you want to shift focus,** edit the task source. Change "Read TODO.md" to "Focus only on the API module" and the next iteration follows the new direction.

**When the agent is too ambitious,** tighten the scope constraint:

```markdown
- Touch at most 3 files per iteration
- Do not refactor code that isn't directly related to the current task
```

## Prompt size and context windows

Keep your prompt focused. A long prompt with every possible instruction eats into the agent's context window, leaving less room for the actual codebase.

Rules of thumb:

- **Core prompt:** 20-50 lines is the sweet spot. Enough to be specific, short enough to leave room for work.
- **Commands:** Pick the 2-3 most useful signals. Don't add commands whose output the agent doesn't need.
- **User args:** Use `{{ args.name }}` to make ralphs reusable — pass project-specific values from the CLI instead of hardcoding them in the prompt. Args also work in command `run` strings (e.g., `run: gh issue view {{ args.issue }}`).
- **Command output:** Can be long. If your commands produce verbose output, consider using scripts that filter to the relevant lines.
- **Working directory:** Commands run from the project root by default. Commands starting with `./` run from the ralph directory — handy for bundling helper scripts next to your `RALPH.md`.
