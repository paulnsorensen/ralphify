<strong>Put your AI coding agent in a <code>while True</code> loop and let it ship.</strong>

Ralphify is a minimal CLI harness for autonomous AI coding loops, inspired by the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). It pipes a prompt to an AI coding agent, validates the work with checks, and repeats — each iteration starts with a fresh context window.

## Install

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```bash
    uv tool install ralphify
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install ralphify
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install ralphify
    ```

## Two commands to start

```bash
ralph init      # Creates ralph.toml + PROMPT.md
ralph run       # Starts the loop (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

`ralph init` creates a config file and a starter prompt. `ralph run` reads the prompt, pipes it to the agent, waits for it to finish, and does it again. Edit `PROMPT.md` while the loop is running — changes take effect on the next iteration.

Or skip setup and pass a prompt directly:

```bash
ralph run -n 1 -p "Add type hints to all public functions in src/"
```

### What it looks like

```
$ ralph run -n 3 --log-dir ralph_logs

── Iteration 1 ──
✓ Iteration 1 completed (52.3s) → ralph_logs/001_20250115-142301.log
  Checks: 2 passed
    ✓ lint
    ✓ tests

── Iteration 2 ──
✗ Iteration 2 failed with exit code 1 (23.1s)
  Checks: 1 passed, 1 failed
    ✓ lint
    ✗ tests (exit 1)

── Iteration 3 ──
✓ Iteration 3 completed (41.7s) → ralph_logs/003_20250115-143012.log
  Checks: 2 passed
    ✓ lint
    ✓ tests

Done: 3 iteration(s) — 2 succeeded, 1 failed
```

Iteration 2 broke a test. Iteration 3 automatically received the failure output and fixed it — that's the self-healing loop in action.

## Why it works

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-repeat:{ .lg .middle } **One thing per loop**

    ---

    The agent picks a task, implements it, tests it, and commits. Then the next iteration starts fresh — no accumulated state, no context window bloat.

-   :material-refresh:{ .lg .middle } **Fresh context every time**

    ---

    Each iteration re-reads `PROMPT.md` and the codebase from scratch. The agent always works from the current state, not stale assumptions.

-   :material-source-branch:{ .lg .middle } **Progress lives in git**

    ---

    Code and commits are the only state that persists. If something goes wrong, `git reset --hard` and run more loops. No hidden state to debug.

-   :material-sign-direction:{ .lg .middle } **The prompt is a tuning knob**

    ---

    When the agent does something dumb, add a sign to the prompt. "SLIDE DOWN, DON'T JUMP." The next iteration follows the new rules.

## Three primitives

Ralphify extends the basic loop with three building blocks that live in the `.ralph/` directory:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-check-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Checks**

    ---

    Run after each iteration to validate the agent's work — tests, linters, type checks. Failed check output feeds into the next iteration so the agent can fix its own mistakes.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](primitives.md#checks)

-   :material-database-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Contexts**

    ---

    Inject dynamic data into the prompt before each iteration — recent git history, current test status, API responses. The agent always sees fresh information.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](primitives.md#contexts)

-   :material-file-document-edit-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Instructions**

    ---

    Reusable rules and coding standards injected into the prompt. Toggle them on and off without editing `PROMPT.md` — useful for style guides, commit conventions, or safety constraints.

## The self-healing loop

Checks create a feedback loop that makes the agent self-correcting:

```
Iteration N    Agent makes a change
               Check runs → test fails

Iteration N+1  Agent sees failure output in prompt
               Fixes the broken test → checks pass

Iteration N+2  No failures from previous iteration
               Agent moves on to the next task
```

You define what "valid" means. Ralphify feeds failures back into the prompt automatically. The agent doesn't need to remember anything — check output tells it exactly what went wrong.
