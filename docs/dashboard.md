# Web Dashboard

Ralphify includes a web-based orchestration dashboard that lets you manage
multiple runs, watch iterations in real time, and edit primitives — all from
your browser.

## Install

The dashboard requires optional dependencies:

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv pip install ralphify[ui]
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install ralphify[ui]
    ```

This adds FastAPI, uvicorn, and WebSocket support.

## Launch

```bash
ralph ui
```

The dashboard opens at [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765).

| Option    | Default       | Description              |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| `--port`  | `8765`        | Port to serve the UI on  |
| `--host`  | `127.0.0.1`   | Host to bind to          |

To expose the dashboard on your network:

```bash
ralph ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

## What you can do

### Start and manage runs

Click **New Run** in the sidebar to start an autonomous loop. The modal lets you:

- **Pick a named prompt** — cards show every prompt discovered in `.ralph/prompts/`
- **Enter an ad-hoc prompt** — type a one-off task without creating a file
- **Configure settings** — max iterations, delay between iterations, timeout, and stop-on-error

Once a run starts, you can **pause**, **resume**, or **stop** it from the sidebar or the run view.

### Watch iterations live

The **Timeline** tab shows each iteration as it completes:

- Pass/fail status with color-coded badges
- Agent output (truncated to 5,000 characters, same as the CLI)
- Check results with individual pass/fail/timeout indicators
- Duration and return codes

Events stream over WebSocket, so the page updates without refreshing.

### Track check health

Each check gets a sparkline bar showing its pass/fail history across iterations.
Green means pass, red means fail, yellow means timeout. This makes it easy to
spot flaky checks or regressions at a glance.

### Browse and edit primitives

The **Primitives** tab lists all checks, contexts, instructions, and prompts in
your project. You can:

- View the frontmatter and body of each primitive
- Create new primitives
- Edit existing ones
- Delete primitives you no longer need

Changes are written directly to the `.ralph/` directory on disk.

### Review run history

The **History** tab shows all past runs organized by status — completed,
stopped, and failed. Click any run to see its full iteration timeline and
check results.

## Architecture

The dashboard is a single-page app that talks to a FastAPI backend:

```
Browser (Preact + htm)
  ↕ WebSocket (live events)
  ↕ REST API (run management, primitives)
FastAPI (uvicorn)
  ↕ RunManager (threading)
  ↕ run_loop (engine.py)
```

- **Backend**: FastAPI serves the REST API and WebSocket endpoint. Each run
  executes in its own thread using the same `run_loop()` that powers the CLI.
- **Frontend**: A Preact app bundled with esbuild. No build step needed to use
  it — the compiled bundle ships with the package.
- **Events**: The run loop emits structured events (iteration started, check
  passed, check failed, etc.) into a queue. An async task drains the queue and
  broadcasts events to all connected WebSocket clients.

## REST API

The dashboard exposes a REST API you can use directly:

| Method | Endpoint                                              | Description                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/runs`                                           | Create and start a new run     |
| GET    | `/api/runs`                                           | List all runs                  |
| GET    | `/api/runs/{run_id}`                                  | Get run details and iterations |
| POST   | `/api/runs/{run_id}/pause`                            | Pause a running run            |
| POST   | `/api/runs/{run_id}/resume`                           | Resume a paused run            |
| POST   | `/api/runs/{run_id}/stop`                             | Stop a run                     |
| PATCH  | `/api/runs/{run_id}/settings`                         | Update runtime settings        |
| GET    | `/api/projects/{project_dir}/primitives`              | List all primitives            |
| GET    | `/api/projects/{project_dir}/primitives/{kind}/{name}`| Get a specific primitive       |
| PUT    | `/api/projects/{project_dir}/primitives/{kind}/{name}`| Update a primitive             |
| POST   | `/api/projects/{project_dir}/primitives/{kind}`       | Create a new primitive         |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/{project_dir}/primitives/{kind}/{name}`| Delete a primitive             |

Connect to `/ws` for live event streaming via WebSocket.
