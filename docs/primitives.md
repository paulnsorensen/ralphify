# Primitives

Primitives are reusable building blocks that extend your loop. They live in the `.ralph/` directory and are automatically discovered by ralphify.

There are three kinds:

| Primitive | Purpose | Runs when |
|---|---|---|
| [Checks](#checks) | Validate the agent's work (tests, linters) | After each iteration |
| [Contexts](#contexts) | Inject dynamic data into the prompt | Before each iteration |
| [Instructions](#instructions) | Inject static text into the prompt | Before each iteration |

## Checks

Checks run **after** each iteration to validate what the agent did. If a check fails, its output (and optional failure instructions) are appended to the next iteration's prompt so the agent can fix the problem.

### Creating a check

```bash
ralph new check my-tests
```

This creates `.ralph/checks/my-tests/CHECK.md`:

```markdown
---
command: ruff check .
timeout: 60
enabled: true
---
```

Edit the frontmatter to set your validation command:

```markdown
---
command: pytest -x
timeout: 120
enabled: true
---
Fix all failing tests. Do not skip or delete tests.
```

The body text below the frontmatter is the **failure instruction** — it gets included in the prompt alongside the check output when the check fails. Use it to tell the agent how you want failures handled.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `command` | string | — | Command to run (see [command parsing](#command-parsing) below) |
| `timeout` | int | `60` | Max seconds before the check is killed |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to skip without deleting |

!!! warning "Checks need a command or script"
    A check must have either a `command` in its frontmatter or an executable `run.*` script in its directory. Checks that have neither are **skipped with a warning** during discovery. If `ralph status` shows fewer checks than you expect, verify each check has a command or script configured.

### Command parsing

Commands are split with Python's `shlex.split()` and executed **directly** — not through a shell. This means:

- Simple commands work as expected: `uv run pytest -x`, `npm test`, `ruff check .`
- Shell features like **pipes** (`|`), **redirections** (`2>&1`, `>`), **chaining** (`&&`, `||`), and **variable expansion** (`$VAR`) do **not** work
- Arguments with spaces need quoting: `pytest "tests/my dir/"` works correctly

If you need shell features, use a [script](#using-a-script-instead-of-a-command) instead.

### Using a script instead of a command

Instead of a `command` in frontmatter, you can place an executable script named `run.*` (e.g. `run.sh`, `run.py`) in the check directory:

```
.ralph/checks/my-tests/
├── CHECK.md
└── run.sh
```

If both a `command` and a `run.*` script exist, the script takes precedence. Scripts and commands always run with the **project root** as the working directory, not the primitive's directory.

### HTML comments are stripped

You can use HTML comments in any primitive file for internal notes — they're stripped before the content is injected into the prompt:

```markdown
---
command: pytest -x
timeout: 120
enabled: true
---
<!-- TODO: consider adding --tb=short flag -->
<!-- Agreed on this policy in sprint retro 2025-01-10 -->
Fix all failing tests. Do not skip or delete tests.
```

The agent never sees the comments. This is useful for documenting why a check exists or what you've tried.

### How check failures appear in the prompt

When a check fails, ralphify appends a section like this to the next iteration's prompt:

````markdown
## Check Failures

The following checks failed after the last iteration. Fix these issues:

### my-tests
**Exit code:** 1

```
FAILED tests/test_foo.py::test_bar - AssertionError
```

Fix all failing tests. Do not skip or delete tests.
````

## Contexts

Contexts inject **dynamic data** into the prompt before each iteration. Use them to give the agent fresh information like recent git history, open issues, or file listings.

### Creating a context

```bash
ralph new context git-log
```

This creates `.ralph/contexts/git-log/CONTEXT.md`:

```markdown
---
command: git log --oneline -10
timeout: 30
enabled: true
---
```

The command runs each iteration and its stdout is injected into the prompt.

### Static content

The body below the frontmatter is **static content** that gets included above the command output:

```markdown
---
command: git log --oneline -10
timeout: 30
enabled: true
---
## Recent commits

Here are the latest commits for reference:
```

A context can also be purely static (no command) — just omit the `command` field and write the content in the body.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `command` | string | — | Command whose stdout is captured (see [command parsing](#command-parsing)) |
| `timeout` | int | `30` | Max seconds before the command is killed |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to skip without deleting |

### Using a script instead of a command

Just like checks, you can place an executable script named `run.*` (e.g. `run.sh`, `run.py`) in the context directory instead of using a `command` in frontmatter:

```
.ralph/contexts/project-info/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── run.sh
```

If both a `command` and a `run.*` script exist, the script takes precedence. Scripts and commands always run with the **project root** as the working directory.

This is useful for contexts that need more complex logic than a single shell command — for example, querying an API, combining multiple data sources, or running a Python script that formats output.

### Placement in the prompt

By default, all context output is appended to the end of the prompt. To control where it appears, use placeholders in your `PROMPT.md`:

```markdown
# Prompt

{{ contexts.git-log }}

Work on the next task from the plan.

{{ contexts }}
```

- `{{ contexts.git-log }}` — places that specific context's output here
- `{{ contexts }}` — places all remaining contexts (those not already placed by name)
- If no placeholders are found, all context output is appended to the end

## Instructions

Instructions inject **static text** into the prompt. Use them for reusable rules, style guides, or constraints that you want to add or remove without editing the prompt file.

### Creating an instruction

```bash
ralph new instruction code-style
```

This creates `.ralph/instructions/code-style/INSTRUCTION.md`:

```markdown
---
enabled: true
---
```

Write your instruction content in the body:

```markdown
---
enabled: true
---
Always use type hints on function signatures.
Keep functions under 30 lines.
Never use print() for logging — use the logging module.
```

!!! note "Empty instructions are excluded"
    Instructions with no body text (only frontmatter) are silently excluded from prompt injection, even when `enabled: true`. If an instruction isn't appearing in your prompt, make sure it has content below the frontmatter.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to skip without deleting |

### Placement in the prompt

Same rules as contexts:

- `{{ instructions.code-style }}` — places that specific instruction here
- `{{ instructions }}` — places all remaining instructions
- If no placeholders are found, all instructions are appended to the end

## Viewing your primitives

Use `ralph status` to see all discovered primitives and whether they're enabled:

```bash
ralph status
```
