# Codebase Map

Quick orientation guide for anyone working on this codebase — human contributors and AI coding agents alike.

## What this project is

Ralphify is a CLI tool (`ralph`) that runs AI coding agents in autonomous loops. It reads a RALPH.md file from a ralph directory, runs commands, assembles a prompt with the output, pipes it to an agent command via stdin, waits for it to finish, then repeats. Each iteration gets a fresh context window. Progress is tracked through git commits.

The core loop is simple. The complexity lives in **prompt assembly** — running commands and resolving placeholders into the prompt before each iteration.

## Architecture: how the pieces connect

The CLI entry point is `cli.py:run()`, which parses options, reads the ralph directory path, and delegates to `engine.py:run_loop()` for the actual iteration cycle. The engine emits structured events via an `EventEmitter`, making the same loop reusable from both the CLI and any external orchestration layer (such as `manager.py`).

```

```

### Placeholder resolution

The resolver (`_resolver.py`) handles three placeholder kinds: `{{ commands.<name> }}`, `{{ args.<name> }}`, and `{{ ralph.<name> }}`. Two functions:

- **`resolve_all()`** — resolves all three placeholder kinds in a **single pass** so that a value inserted by one kind (e.g., an arg value containing `{{ commands.foo }}`) is never re-processed as the other kind. Used by the engine for final prompt assembly. The `ralph.*` placeholders (`ralph.name`, `ralph.iteration`, `ralph.max_iterations`) provide runtime metadata and require no frontmatter configuration.
- **`resolve_args()`** — resolves only `{{ args.<name> }}` placeholders. Used by the engine to expand arg references inside command `run` strings before executing them.

Unmatched placeholders resolve to empty string in both functions.

### Event system

The run loop communicates via structured events (`_events.py`). Each event has a type (`EventType` enum), run ID, typed data payload, and UTC timestamp.

Event data uses TypedDict classes — one per event type — rather than free-form dicts. The key types:

- **`RunStartedData`** / **`RunStoppedData`** — run lifecycle (stop reason is a `StopReason` literal: `"completed"`, `"error"`, `"user_requested"`)
- **`IterationStartedData`** / **`IterationEndedData`** — per-iteration data (return code, duration, log path)
- **`CommandsStartedData`** / **`CommandsCompletedData`** — command execution bookends
- **`PromptAssembledData`** — prompt length after placeholder resolution
- **`AgentActivityData`** — streaming agent output (Claude Code only)
- **`AgentOutputLineData`** — raw line of agent output from any agent (powers live peek)
- **`LogMessageData`** — info/error messages with optional traceback

All payload types are unioned as `EventData`.

Emitter implementations:

- **`EventEmitter`** — protocol that any listener implements (just an `emit(event)` method)
- **`NullEmitter`** — discards events (used in tests)
- **`QueueEmitter`** — pushes events into a `queue.Queue` for async consumption
- **`FanoutEmitter`** — broadcasts events to multiple emitters
- **`BoundEmitter`** — wraps any emitter with a fixed run ID, so callers don't have to pass the ID on every emit. The engine creates one per run and threads it through all internal functions.

The CLI uses a `ConsoleEmitter` (defined in `_console_emitter.py`) that renders events to the terminal with Rich formatting.

### Multi-run management

`manager.py:RunManager` orchestrates concurrent runs:

- Creates runs with unique IDs and wraps them in `ManagedRun` (config + state + emitter + thread)
- Starts each run in a daemon thread via `engine.run_loop()`
- Supports pause/resume/stop per run via `RunState` thread-safe control methods
- Uses `FanoutEmitter` to broadcast events to multiple listeners

## Key files to understand first

1. **`engine.py`** — The core run loop. Uses `RunConfig` and `RunState` (from `_run_types.py`) and `EventEmitter`. This is where iteration logic lives.
2. **`_run_types.py`** — `RunConfig`, `RunState`, `RunStatus`, and `Command`. These are the shared data types used by the engine, CLI, and manager.
3. **`cli.py`** — All CLI commands. Validates frontmatter fields via extracted helpers (`_validate_agent`, `_validate_commands`, `_validate_credit`, `_validate_run_options`, `_validate_declared_args`), builds a `RunConfig`, and delegates to `engine.run_loop()` for the actual loop. Terminal event rendering lives in `_console_emitter.py`.
4. **`_frontmatter.py`** — YAML frontmatter parsing. Extracts `agent`, `commands`, `args` from the RALPH.md file.
5. **`_resolver.py`** — Template placeholder logic. Small file but critical.
## Traps and gotchas

### If you change frontmatter fields...

Frontmatter parsing is in `_frontmatter.py:parse_frontmatter()`, which returns a raw dict. Each field is then validated and coerced by a dedicated helper in `cli.py` — e.g. `_validate_agent()`, `_validate_commands()`, `_validate_credit()`. Adding a new frontmatter field means adding a new validator in `cli.py` and wiring it into `_build_run_config()`.

**Field name constants** (`FIELD_AGENT`, `FIELD_COMMANDS`, `FIELD_ARGS`, `FIELD_CREDIT`, `CMD_FIELD_NAME`, `CMD_FIELD_RUN`, `CMD_FIELD_TIMEOUT`) are centralized in `_frontmatter.py`. Always import these constants instead of hardcoding strings like `"agent"` or `"commands"` — this keeps error messages, validation, and placeholder resolution in sync when fields are renamed.

### If you add a new CLI command...

Add it in `cli.py`. The CLI uses Typer. Update `docs/cli.md` to document the new command.

### If you change the event system...

Events are defined in `_events.py:EventType`, with a corresponding TypedDict payload class for each type. Adding a new event type requires a new `EventType` member, a new TypedDict payload class, adding it to the `EventData` union, and handling it in `ConsoleEmitter` (`_console_emitter.py`).

### Live agent output (peek)

Both execution paths in `_agent.py` accept an `on_output_line(line, stream)` callback and drain the agent's stdout/stderr line-by-line — the blocking path uses two background reader threads, and the streaming path forwards each raw line from `_read_agent_stream`. The engine wires this callback to emit `EventType.AGENT_OUTPUT_LINE` events, which the `ConsoleEmitter` renders only while peek is enabled. The `p` keybinding flips that state via `ConsoleEmitter.toggle_peek()`, driven by `KeypressListener` in `_keypress.py`. The listener only activates on a real TTY; in CI or when stdin is piped it silently no-ops.

The compact peek panel (`_IterationPanel` / `_IterationSpinner`) renders the most recent `_MAX_VISIBLE_SCROLL` lines while buffering up to `_MAX_SCROLL_LINES` (`_console_emitter.py`). Shift+P (`FULLSCREEN_PEEK_KEY`) enters a `_FullscreenPeek` view — a Rich `Live` with `screen=True` that renders the full buffer on the alt screen and accepts vim/less-style navigation (`j/k`, `space/b`, `g/G`, `q`). All keys route through a single `ConsoleEmitter.handle_key()` method that owns the keybinding map for both compact and fullscreen modes. Entering fullscreen stops the compact `Live` so only one renderer owns the terminal; exiting (or iteration end) tears the alt screen down and restores the compact panel with its still-growing buffer.

### Credit trailer

When `credit` is `true` (the default), `engine.py:_assemble_prompt()` appends `_CREDIT_INSTRUCTION` to the prompt — a short instruction telling the agent to include a `Co-authored-by: Ralphify` trailer in git commits. Users can opt out with `credit: false` in frontmatter.

### CLI adapters

Each supported agent CLI lives in its own module under `src/ralphify/adapters/`:

- `_protocol.py` — the `CLIAdapter` Protocol, `AdapterEvent` NamedTuple, and the `ADAPTERS` registry. Concrete adapters import from here, not from the package `__init__`, to avoid the circular import a package-level Protocol would create.
- `_generic.py` — fallback adapter for unknown CLIs. All capability flags are False; `install_wind_down_hook` raises `NotImplementedError`.
- `claude.py` — streams `--output-format stream-json --verbose`, parses assistant `tool_use` blocks, and installs a `PreToolUse` hook via `settings.json` + `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.
- `codex.py` — streams JSONL, installs a `PostToolUse` hook via `hooks.json` + `config.toml` (`[features]\ncodex_hooks = true`) + `CODEX_HOME`. Hook only matches the `Bash` tool today; documented limitation.
- `copilot.py` — best-effort tool-use counting; raises `NotImplementedError` from `install_wind_down_hook` so the engine downgrades to hard-cap-only mode.

The registry is populated at first package import. Adding a new CLI means writing one adapter module and listing it in `_register_builtin_adapters()` — no edits to the engine, emitter, or subprocess machinery.

### Soft wind-down lifecycle (`_agent.py` + `_wind_down_shim.py`)

When `max_turns` is set and the active adapter advertises `supports_soft_wind_down = True`, `_run_agent_streaming` calls `_setup_wind_down(...)` which:

1. `tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="ralphify-")` creates a per-iteration tempdir.
2. The counter file is written (`"0"`) at `<log_dir>/<iter>.turncount` if `log_dir` is configured, else `<tempdir>/turncount` (FR-11).
3. `adapter.install_wind_down_hook(tempdir, counter_path, cap, grace)` writes the CLI's hook config files into the tempdir and returns env-var overrides (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CODEX_HOME`).
4. The streaming `on_tool_use` callback is wrapped so each event atomically rewrites `counter_path` (write-to-`.tmp` then `os.replace`) before delegating to user hooks.
5. The hook command points at `python -m ralphify._wind_down_shim <counter_path> <cap> <grace> <agent>`. The shim re-reads the counter on every invocation and prints the wind-down JSON payload to stdout when `count >= max(cap - grace, 0)`. Failures (missing counter, unknown agent, parse errors) silently exit 0.
6. A nested `try/finally` guarantees the tempdir and counter file are removed even when `Popen` raises or the iteration crashes (FR-7).

If the installer raises `NotImplementedError` (Copilot, generic), `_setup_wind_down` cleans up the half-initialised tempdir, logs a one-time warning, and returns `None` — the iteration runs hard-cap-only.

### Subprocess result types

`_output.py` defines `ProcessResult`, the base dataclass for subprocess results (provides `returncode`, `timed_out`, and a `success` property). Both `_runner.py:RunResult` (command execution) and `_agent.py:AgentResult` (agent execution) extend it. If you add a new subprocess wrapper, inherit from `ProcessResult` to get consistent success/timeout semantics. The module also provides `ensure_str()` for bytes-to-string decoding, `collect_output()` for combining stdout+stderr, and `SUBPROCESS_TEXT_KWARGS` — the shared kwargs dict used by all `subprocess.Popen` calls to ensure consistent encoding and stream handling.

### If you change shutdown or signal handling...

Agent subprocesses run in their own process group (`start_new_session=True` on POSIX, configured via `SESSION_KWARGS` in `_output.py`). This lets `_kill_process_group()` send signals to the agent and all its children at once.

The two-stage Ctrl+C flow:

1. **First Ctrl+C** — the engine's SIGINT handler sets `RunState.stop_requested`, which lets the current iteration finish gracefully.
2. **Second Ctrl+C** — `KeyboardInterrupt` propagates normally and the agent process is killed.

Timeout and cancellation both use a two-step kill: SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL after `_SIGTERM_GRACE_PERIOD` seconds (3s). If you add a new subprocess wrapper, use `_kill_process_group()` and `SESSION_KWARGS` to get consistent cleanup behavior.

### Command parsing

Commands in RALPH.md frontmatter are parsed with `shlex.split()` — no shell features. For shell features, users point the `run` field at a script.

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest           # Run all tests
uv run pytest -x        # Stop on first failure
```

Tests are in `tests/` with one file per module. All tests use temporary directories and don't require any external services.

## Dependencies

Minimal by design:

- **typer** — CLI framework
- **rich** — Terminal formatting (used via typer's console)
- **pyyaml** — YAML frontmatter parsing in `_frontmatter.py`

Dev dependencies: pytest, mkdocs, mkdocs-material.
