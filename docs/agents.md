# Using with Different Agents

Ralphify works with **any CLI that reads a prompt from stdin and exits when done**. Claude Code is the default, but you can swap in any tool that follows this contract.

This page shows how to configure ralphify for popular agents and how to write your own wrapper.

## What ralphify needs from an agent

Every iteration, ralphify runs your agent like this:

```
echo "<assembled prompt>" | <command> <args...>
```

Your agent must:

1. **Read a prompt from stdin** — the full assembled prompt (with contexts, instructions, and any check failures) is piped in
2. **Do work in the current directory** — edit files, run commands, make commits
3. **Exit when done** — exit code 0 means success, non-zero means failure

That's it. No special protocol, no API — just stdin in, work done, process exits.

## Claude Code

The default configuration. Claude Code's `-p` flag reads from stdin and runs non-interactively.

```toml
[agent]
command = "claude"
args = ["-p", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-p` | Non-interactive mode — reads prompt from stdin, prints output, exits |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skips approval prompts so the agent can work autonomously |

Install Claude Code:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

!!! info "Why `--dangerously-skip-permissions`?"
    Without this flag, Claude Code pauses to ask for approval before editing files, running commands, or making commits. In an autonomous loop, nobody is there to approve — so the agent would hang forever. Checks act as your guardrails instead.

## Aider

[Aider](https://aider.chat) is an AI pair-programming tool that works with multiple LLM providers. It supports a message flag that accepts the prompt directly.

```toml
[agent]
command = "bash"
args = ["-c", "aider --yes-always --no-auto-commits --message \"$(cat -)\""]
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--yes-always` | Auto-approve all changes (no interactive prompts) |
| `--no-auto-commits` | Let your prompt control when commits happen |
| `--message "..."` | Pass the prompt as a message instead of stdin |

!!! note "Why the bash wrapper?"
    Aider doesn't natively read prompts from stdin. The `bash -c` wrapper reads stdin with `cat -` and passes it as a `--message` argument. This is a common pattern for adapting tools that don't support piped input directly.

### Aider with a specific model

```toml
[agent]
command = "bash"
args = ["-c", "aider --yes-always --no-auto-commits --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --message \"$(cat -)\""]
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

## Codex CLI

[OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) can be configured to run non-interactively.

```toml
[agent]
command = "bash"
args = ["-c", "codex --approval-mode full-auto \"$(cat -)\""]
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--approval-mode full-auto` | Skip all approval prompts for autonomous operation |

## Custom wrapper script

For full control, write a wrapper script that reads stdin and calls your agent however it needs to be called.

**`ralph-agent.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Read the prompt from stdin
PROMPT=$(cat -)

# Call your agent however it works
# Examples:
#   curl an API, save response, apply changes
#   call a local LLM with the prompt
#   pipe to any tool that accepts text input

my-custom-agent --input "$PROMPT" --auto-approve
```

```bash
chmod +x ralph-agent.sh
```

**`ralph.toml`**

```toml
[agent]
command = "./ralph-agent.sh"
args = []
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

### Python wrapper example

**`ralph-agent.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Custom agent wrapper that reads a prompt from stdin."""

import subprocess
import sys

prompt = sys.stdin.read()

# Transform the prompt, call APIs, run tools — whatever you need
result = subprocess.run(
    ["my-tool", "--prompt", prompt],
    check=True,
)

sys.exit(result.returncode)
```

```bash
chmod +x ralph-agent.py
```

```toml
[agent]
command = "./ralph-agent.py"
args = []
prompt = "PROMPT.md"
```

## Testing your agent setup

Before running the full loop, verify your agent works with a simple prompt:

```bash
echo "Say hello and create a file called test.txt with the word 'hello' in it." | <your-command> <your-args>
```

Then check:

```bash
cat test.txt   # Should contain "hello"
rm test.txt    # Clean up
```

If this works, your agent is compatible with ralphify. Run `ralph status` to verify the full setup:

```bash
ralph status
```

You should see a green checkmark next to your command:

```
✓ Command '<your-command>' found on PATH
```

## Agent compatibility checklist

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| Reads prompt from stdin (or via wrapper) | Ralphify pipes the assembled prompt to the agent's stdin |
| Works non-interactively | No human is present to approve actions during the loop |
| Exits when done | Ralphify waits for the process to finish before running checks |
| Returns meaningful exit codes | Exit 0 = success, non-zero = failure (used by `--stop-on-error`) |
| Operates on files in the current directory | Checks validate the project state after the agent runs |

## Tips for non-Claude-Code agents

**Disable auto-commits if your prompt handles commits.** Most agents have an auto-commit feature. If your `PROMPT.md` includes commit instructions, disable the agent's built-in commits to avoid double-committing or conflicts.

**Test with `-n 1` first.** Run a single iteration to verify the agent receives the prompt correctly and produces useful output:

```bash
ralph run -n 1 --log-dir ralph_logs
cat ralph_logs/001_*.log
```

**Use `--timeout` as a safety net.** If the agent hangs or enters an interactive mode you didn't expect, the timeout kills it so the loop doesn't stall forever:

```bash
ralph run --timeout 300
```

**Check that the agent's PATH is correct.** Some agents need specific tools (compilers, linters, package managers) available. Make sure everything the agent might call is on your PATH before starting the loop.
