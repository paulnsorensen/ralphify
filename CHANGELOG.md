# Changelog

All notable changes to ralphify are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **CLI adapter layer** — pluggable `Adapter` protocol with implementations for Claude, Codex, Copilot, and a generic fallback. Adapters own command-line flag injection (e.g. Claude's `--output-format stream-json`, Codex's `--json`), per-CLI event parsing, and promise-tag completion detection.
- **`max_turns` / `max_turns_grace` frontmatter fields** — cap the number of tool-use events per iteration. The agent is SIGTERM'd at `max_turns`; an optional soft wind-down message is injected `max_turns_grace` events earlier so Claude/Codex can hand off cleanly.
- **Agent lifecycle hooks** — `AgentHook` protocol with `ShellAgentHook` (shell command) and `CombinedAgentHook` (fanout) implementations. Register via the `hooks` frontmatter field to observe iteration start/end, prompt assembly, tool use, turn cap, and completion events. See the new `docs/hooks.md` page.
- **Per-CLI soft wind-down** — Claude's `PreToolUse` and Codex's `PostToolUse` hooks are installed into a per-iteration tempdir (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` overrides) so the user's real config stays untouched.
- **Codex example ralph** — `examples/codex/RALPH.md` demonstrates running Codex with `max_turns` and a `completion_signal`.

## 0.4.0b3 — 2026-04-12

### Improved

- **Full-screen peek scrollbar** — a scrollbar on the right edge of the full-screen peek view shows your position in the activity log, so you always know where you are in a long session.
- **Thinking traces visible** — agent reasoning (thinking blocks) now appears in the activity feed as dim italic text instead of being silently dropped. Long thinking traces are split by newline so you can scroll through the full reasoning.
- **Full text and tool args** — assistant text output is no longer truncated to 100 characters, and tool parameters for Agent and ToolSearch now show their actual values (description, prompt, query, max_results) instead of just listing parameter names.
- **Context token display** — token counts in the panel title now show as `ctx 156k · out 3.2k` instead of `↑156k ↓3.2k`, making context window usage immediately clear.
- **Persistent Shift+P hint** — the compact panel footer now always shows "Shift+P full screen" so new users discover full-screen peek without reading docs.
- **Clearer page navigation labels** — the full-screen footer now says `b page up · space page down` instead of the ambiguous `b/space page`.

### Fixed

- **HTML comments in code blocks** — `<!-- -->` comments inside fenced code blocks in RALPH.md files no longer break prompt assembly.

---

## 0.4.0b2 — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Full-screen peek (`shift+P`)** — the compact peek panel only shows the ten most recent activity lines, so earlier tool calls from a long iteration scrolled out of view. Press **shift+P** to open a full-screen, scrollable view of the entire activity buffer on the terminal's alt screen. Navigate with `j/k` (line), `space/b` (page), `g/G` (top/bottom), and `q` or `P` to exit. Agent activity keeps streaming in while you scroll, and scrolling back to the bottom re-enables follow mode. The view auto-exits when the iteration ends, so you're never stuck in an alt screen showing dead buffer. The scroll buffer now keeps up to 5000 lines per iteration (was 50) so full-screen peek has something to show.

### Fixed

- **Peek toggle now restores previous terminal state** — toggling peek off used to leave the live activity region in the scrollback, so returning to the compact view looked different from before you pressed `p`. The peek region is now transient: toggling off restores the terminal to exactly the state it was in before peek was enabled, matching the behavior pre-0.4.0.
- **Peek scroll buffer preserved across toggles** — hitting `p` to hide peek used to drop the scroll buffer, so toggling back on showed an empty feed until new activity arrived. The buffer now survives toggles, so you immediately see the latest state on re-enable.
- **Double-slash in shortened paths** — `_shorten_path` now correctly handles absolute paths outside `$HOME` (e.g. `/usr/local/...`), producing `/…/file.py` instead of `//…/file.py` in the activity feed.

---

## 0.4.0b1 — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Structured live activity panel for Claude agents** — when you run `ralph run` with a Claude agent, pressing `p` now shows a compact, readable activity panel instead of raw JSON. The panel shows a live spinner with elapsed time, token counts, the current tool in progress, and a scrolling log of tool calls and assistant messages above it. Tool calls are rendered as one-liners (e.g. `🔧 Bash  uv run pytest`), thinking shows as a status flicker, and errors are highlighted. Non-Claude agents keep the previous raw-line output. The panel is best-effort — a rendering failure never interrupts the run loop.
- **Live agent output streaming (on by default, `p` toggles)** — when you run `ralph run` in an interactive terminal, the agent's output now streams live to the console. Press `p` to hide and `p` again to show. Live streaming is disabled automatically when the output is not a terminal (piped, redirected, or CI). When `--log-dir` is set, output is still captured to the log file.

### Changed

- **`ralph init` renamed to `ralph scaffold`** — the command that creates a new ralph from a template is now `ralph scaffold`. Same behavior, clearer name.
- **Installed ralphs moved from `.ralphify/ralphs/` to `.agents/ralphs/`** — `ralph run <name>` now looks for installed ralphs in `.agents/ralphs/` (project-level) and `~/.agents/ralphs/` (user-level). The old `.ralphify/ralphs/` path is no longer checked. If you have ralphs installed there, move them to `.agents/ralphs/`.
- **`AgentResult.returncode` is `None` on timeout** — `AgentResult.returncode` and `IterationEndedData.returncode` now consistently return `None` when the agent times out (previously the blocking path returned the kill signal's exit code, e.g. `-9`). The streaming path already behaved this way; this change aligns both paths with the documented `ProcessResult` contract. **API consumers:** if you log or emit metrics keyed on `returncode` for timed-out iterations, check the `timed_out` field first.

### Removed

- **`ralph add` removed** — ralph installation and package management has moved to [agr](https://github.com/computerlovetech/agr). Use `agr add owner/repo` to install ralphs from GitHub.
- **`ralph new` removed** — use `ralph scaffold` to create ralphs from a template, or write the `RALPH.md` by hand.

### Fixed

- **Frontmatter round-trip corruption** — `serialize_frontmatter` no longer corrupts files when the body starts with `---`.
- **Rich markup injection** — user-provided strings in CLI output are now escaped to prevent Rich markup interpretation.
- **Timeout enforcement on silent agents** — `--timeout` now works even when the agent produces no output.
- **Process cleanup** — fixed multiple edge cases in subprocess lifecycle: pipe leaks, thread joins, process group kills, and SIGKILL fallback.
- **Keypress listener resilience** — handles EINTR and SIGCONT signals without crashing.

---

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-24

### Added

- **`ralph add` — install ralphs from GitHub** — share and reuse ralphs across projects. Run `ralph add owner/repo/ralph-name` to fetch a ralph from any GitHub repo and install it locally. Then just `ralph run ralph-name`. Supports installing a single ralph by name, an entire repo as a ralph, or all ralphs in a repo at once. Installed ralphs live in `.ralphify/ralphs/` (gitignored, disposable).
- **Two-stage Ctrl+C** — first Ctrl+C gracefully finishes the current iteration, second Ctrl+C force-stops immediately. Agent subprocesses now run in their own process group for reliable cleanup.
- **Iteration monitor UI** — iteration results are now rendered as markdown using Rich, with a polished run header and cleaner formatting. Thanks to [@malpou](https://github.com/malpou) for contributing this improvement.

### Improved

- **Process group isolation** — agent subprocesses (both streaming and blocking) now run in dedicated process groups, preventing zombie processes on timeout or cancellation.

---

## 0.2.5 — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **ralph placeholders** — ralphs can now access runtime metadata via `{{ ralph.name }}` (ralph directory name), `{{ ralph.iteration }}` (current iteration, 1-based), and `{{ ralph.max_iterations }}` (total iterations if `-n` was set, empty otherwise). No frontmatter configuration needed.

---

## 0.2.4 — 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Placeholder cross-contamination between args and commands** — when an arg value contained text like `{{ commands.tests }}`, the sequential resolution would re-process it as a command placeholder, injecting unrelated output. Placeholders are now resolved in a single pass so inserted values are never re-scanned.
- **Helpful error when command binary is not found** — when a `commands` entry references a binary that isn't installed (e.g. `run: mypy src/`), the error now identifies which command failed and points to the `commands` field. Previously this surfaced as a generic crash with no context.
- **Timed-out agent output not echoed when logging enabled** — when using `--log-dir` and the agent timed out, partial output was written to the log file but silently swallowed from the terminal. Both completion and timeout paths now echo consistently.
- **`--` separator not ending flag parsing in user args** — `ralph run my-ralph -- --verbose ./src` now correctly treats `--verbose` as a positional value instead of parsing it as a flag.
- **Command output garbled when stdout lacked trailing newline** — when a command's stdout didn't end with a newline and stderr was non-empty, the two streams were concatenated directly (e.g. `"test passedwarning: dep"`), producing garbled output in log files and `{{ commands.* }}` placeholder values.
- **Indented `---` in YAML block scalars mistaken for closing frontmatter delimiter** — the frontmatter parser used `line.strip()` to detect the closing `---`, which caused indented `---` inside YAML block scalars (e.g. `notes: |` with `  ---` content) to be treated as the end of the frontmatter. Now only `---` at column 0 is recognized as the closing delimiter.
- **Indented opening `---` delimiter accepted inconsistently** — the opening frontmatter delimiter check used `strip()` which accepted leading whitespace (e.g. `  ---`), while the closing delimiter required column 0. Both delimiters now require `---` at column 0 per the YAML frontmatter spec.
- **Arg values with spaces breaking command execution** — when `{{ args.name }}` placeholders were substituted into command `run` strings, values containing spaces (e.g. `"hello world"`) were split into separate tokens by `shlex.split`, causing the wrong command to execute. Arg values are now shell-quoted before substitution so they are always treated as single tokens.
- **Helpful error when command has invalid syntax** — when a command's `run` string has malformed shell syntax (e.g. unmatched quotes), the error now identifies which command failed and points to the `commands` field. Previously this surfaced as a bare `ValueError` like "No closing quotation" with no context.
- **Empty arg values breaking `./` working directory detection** — when an `{{ args.name }}` placeholder resolved to an empty string, the substitution could introduce leading whitespace that prevented the `./` prefix from being detected, causing the command to run from the project root instead of the ralph directory.
- **Windows `.cmd`/`.exe` extension breaking streaming mode detection** — on Windows, `claude` is installed as `claude.cmd` or `claude.exe`. The streaming mode check compared the full filename (including extension) against `"claude"`, so it never matched. Ralphify now compares the stem only, enabling real-time activity tracking on Windows.

### Improved

- **`BoundEmitter` convenience methods** — `log_info(message)` and `log_error(message, traceback=...)` let Python API users emit log events without constructing `Event` objects manually.
- **Extracted `ProcessResult` base class** — `RunResult` and `AgentResult` now share a common base with consistent `success` / `timed_out` semantics, reducing duplication in `_runner.py` and `_agent.py`.
- **Code quality** — extracted CLI validation helpers, renamed `resolver.py` to `_resolver.py` to match private module convention, deduplicated output echoing and timeout/blocking paths in `_agent.py`, extracted `ensure_str` helper for consistent bytes-to-string decoding.

---

## 0.2.3 — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Co-authored-by credit trailer** — every prompt now includes an instruction telling the agent to add `Co-authored-by: Ralphify <noreply@ralphify.co>` to commit messages. On by default; opt out with `credit: false` in RALPH.md frontmatter.

### Improved

- **Typed event payloads** — replaced `dict[str, Any]` event data with TypedDict classes throughout the engine and console emitter for stronger type safety.
- **Code quality** — standardized imports, extracted constants, simplified TypedDicts with `NotRequired`.

---

## 0.2.2 — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **`ralph init` command** — scaffold a new ralph with a ready-to-customize template, no AI agent required. Run `ralph init my-task` to create a directory with a `RALPH.md` that includes example commands, args, and placeholders. A faster alternative to the AI-guided `ralph new`.
- **`ralphify-cowork` skill** — a Claude Cowork skill that lets non-technical users set up and run autonomous loops from plain English. Handles installation, ralph creation, running, and tweaking — no coding knowledge needed. Install it in Cowork from `skills/ralphify-cowork/`.

---

## 0.2.1 — 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **`{{ args.* }}` placeholders now resolved in command `run` strings** — previously, arg placeholders were only resolved in the prompt body. Commands like `run: gh issue view {{ args.issue }}` would fail because `shlex.split` tokenized the raw placeholder into multiple arguments. Args are now resolved before command execution.

---

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-21

The v2 rewrite. Ralphify is now simpler: a ralph is a directory with a `RALPH.md` file. No more `ralph.toml`, no more `.ralphify/` directory, no more `ralph init`. Everything lives in one file.

### Breaking changes

- **Removed `ralph.toml`** — the agent command is now in the `agent` field of RALPH.md frontmatter. No separate configuration file.
- **Removed `ralph init`** — create a ralph directory with a `RALPH.md` file manually, or use `ralph new`.
- **Removed `.ralphify/` directory** — no more checks, contexts, or named ralphs as separate primitives. Everything is defined in RALPH.md.
- **Removed checks and contexts** — replaced by `commands` in RALPH.md frontmatter. Commands run each iteration and their output is available via `{{ commands.<name> }}` placeholders.
- **`ralph run` requires a path** — `ralph run my-ralph` instead of `ralph run` with optional name. The argument is a path to a directory containing RALPH.md.
- **Placeholder syntax changed** — `{{ contexts.<name> }}` is now `{{ commands.<name> }}`. The `{{ args.<name> }}` syntax is unchanged.
- **User arguments** — pass named flags to your ralph: `ralph run my-ralph --dir ./src`.

### Added

- **`commands` frontmatter field** — define commands that run each iteration directly in RALPH.md. Each command has a `name` and `run` field.
- **Single-file configuration** — the `agent` field, commands, args, and prompt all live in one RALPH.md file.

### Fixed

- **Guard against double-starting a run** — `RunManager` now prevents the same run from being started twice.
- **Eliminate TOCTOU race in RunManager** — `start_run` is now atomic to prevent race conditions in concurrent runs.
- **UTF-8 encoding for all subprocess calls** — prevents encoding errors on systems with non-UTF-8 defaults.
- **Stricter input validation** — reject whitespace-only agent fields, command names, command `run` values, and command strings. Validate negative delay, non-positive `max_iterations`, and timeout values. Validate `commands` field type and reject duplicate command names. Validate command `timeout` field in frontmatter.
- **Clear command placeholders when no commands exist** — matches the existing behavior for args placeholders.
- **Error handling for `os.execvp` in `ralph new`** — graceful error instead of unhandled exception when the agent binary is not found.

### Improved

- **Extensive test coverage** — added unit tests for `_agent.py`, `_events.py`, `ConsoleEmitter`, engine internals, streaming agent execution, command cwd logic, and frontmatter edge cases.
- **Code quality** — extracted magic strings into named constants, consolidated duplicate test helpers, replaced lambda closures with `functools.partial`, and compiled module-level regexes in the resolver.

### How to upgrade from 0.1.x

1. **Move agent config into RALPH.md** — take the `command` and `args` from `ralph.toml` and combine them into the `agent` field in RALPH.md frontmatter.

2. **Convert checks and contexts to commands** — each check/context becomes a command entry:

    ```yaml
    # Before (separate files):
    # .ralphify/checks/tests/CHECK.md with command: uv run pytest -x
    # .ralphify/contexts/git-log/CONTEXT.md with command: git log --oneline -10

    # After (in RALPH.md frontmatter):
    commands:
      - name: tests
        run: uv run pytest -x
      - name: git-log
        run: git log --oneline -10
    ```

3. **Update placeholders** — change `{{ contexts.<name> }}` to `{{ commands.<name> }}`.

4. **Move RALPH.md into a directory** — create a directory for your ralph and put RALPH.md inside it.

5. **Delete old files** — remove `ralph.toml` and the `.ralphify/` directory.

6. **Update CLI usage** — `ralph run` becomes `ralph run <path>`.

## 0.1.12 — 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **New tagline** — updated project tagline to "Stop stressing over not having an agent running. Ralph is always running" across CLI, PyPI, and docs.

---

## 0.1.11 — 2026-03-18

### Improved

- **`ralph new` runs without permission prompts** — Claude Code is now launched with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so the AI-guided setup flow is uninterrupted.
- **Simpler `ralph new` experience** — the skill no longer asks users about checks, contexts, or frontmatter. Just describe what you want to automate in plain English and the agent builds the ralph for you.
- **`ralph new` knows about user arguments** — the skill can now suggest `{{ args.name }}` placeholders when a ralph would benefit from being reusable across projects.

---

## 0.1.10 — 2026-03-18

### Added

- **User arguments for ralphs** — pass `--name value` flags or positional args to `ralph run` and reference them in prompts with `{{ args.name }}` placeholders. Declare positional arg names in frontmatter with `args: [dir, focus]`. Context and check scripts receive user arguments as `RALPH_ARG_<KEY>` environment variables.
- **Quick reference page** — single-page cheat sheet covering CLI commands, directory structure, frontmatter fields, placeholders, and common patterns.
- **Prompt writing guide** — best practices for writing effective RALPH.md prompts, including tips on scoping, context usage, and user arguments.
- **"How it works" page** — explains the iteration lifecycle so users understand the system model.
- **"When to use" guide** — helps users evaluate whether ralph loops fit their task.
- **Agent comparison table** — side-by-side comparison of supported agents with output behavior notes.
- **Expanded cookbook** — new recipes for Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, bug fixing, codebase migration, and multi-ralph project setup.

### Fixed

- Malformed `ralph.toml` now shows a helpful error message instead of a raw `KeyError`.

---

## 0.1.9 — 2026-03-16

Tightened the primitive system: global primitives are now opt-in, context placeholders must be named, and primitives are re-discovered every iteration.

### Breaking changes

- **Explicit primitive dependencies required** — global checks and contexts are no longer auto-applied to all ralphs. Each ralph must declare which global primitives it uses in its frontmatter (`checks: [lint, tests]`, `contexts: [git-log]`). Unknown names produce a clear error. ralph-local primitives still auto-apply.
- **Named placeholders only** — the bulk `{{ contexts }}` placeholder and implicit append behavior have been removed. Each context must be referenced by name (`{{ contexts.git-log }}`). Contexts not referenced by a placeholder are excluded from the prompt.
- **Removed `ralph status` command** — setup validation has been moved into `ralph run` startup, so a separate status command is no longer needed.

### Added

- **Live re-discovery** — primitives are re-discovered every iteration, so adding or editing a check, context, or ralph on disk takes effect on the next cycle without restarting the loop.

---

## 0.1.8 — 2026-03-16

Redesigned `ralph new` with AI-guided setup, and added environment variables for scripts.

### Added

- **AI-guided `ralph new`** — `ralph new` now installs a skill into your agent (Claude Code or Codex) and launches an interactive session where the agent guides you through creating a complete ralph — prompt, checks, and contexts — via conversation. Replaces the old `ralph new check`/`ralph new context`/`ralph new ralph` scaffolding subcommands.
- **`RALPH_NAME` environment variable** — context and check scripts now receive the name of the current ralph in `RALPH_NAME`, so scripts can adapt their behavior based on which ralph is running.

---

## 0.1.7 — 2026-03-12

Simplified the CLI, added a spinner during iterations, and removed the experimental web dashboard to focus on the CLI experience.

### Breaking changes

- **Removed `ralph ui` subcommand and web dashboard** — the experimental web dashboard introduced in 0.1.6 has been removed.
- **Removed `ralph ralphs` subcommand** — `ralph new <name>` is now shorthand for `ralph new ralph <name>`.
- **Removed instructions primitive** — the `instructions` primitive type introduced in 0.1.3 has been removed. Use contexts for injecting reusable rules into prompts instead.
- **Removed ad-hoc prompts (`-p` flag)** — the `--prompt` / `-p` flag on `ralph run` has been removed.

### Added

- **Spinner with elapsed time** — iterations now show a live spinner with elapsed seconds.

### Fixed

- Agent result message is now displayed in CLI output after each iteration.
- Raw Claude Code `stream-json` output no longer leaks to the terminal during iterations.

---

## 0.1.6 — 2026-03-12

Named ralphs, ralph-scoped primitives, and live agent activity streaming.

### Added

- **Named ralphs** — save reusable, task-focused ralphs in `.ralphify/ralphs/<name>/RALPH.md` and switch between them with `ralph run <name>`.
- **Live agent activity streaming** — when the agent command is Claude Code, the engine auto-detects it and uses `--output-format stream-json` with `subprocess.Popen` for line-by-line streaming.
- **Contributor docs** — new `docs/contributing/` section with a codebase map.

### Fixed

- `RUN_STOPPED` event now emits exactly once with the correct stop reason.
- Windows compatibility fix for Unicode characters in terminal output.

---

## 0.1.5 — 2026-03-11

Dashboard UI polish (experimental — dashboard removed in 0.1.7).

---

## 0.1.4 — 2026-03-11

Ad-hoc prompts, better discoverability, and expanded cookbook recipes.

### Added

- **Ad-hoc prompts** — `ralph run -p "Fix the login bug"` passes a prompt directly on the command line.
- **Rust and Go cookbook recipes** — complete copy-pasteable setups.

---

## 0.1.3 — 2026-03-10

The primitives release. Checks, contexts, and instructions turn the basic loop into a self-healing feedback system.

### Added

- **Checks** — post-iteration validation scripts in `.ralphify/checks/`.
- **Contexts** — dynamic data injection in `.ralphify/contexts/`.
- **Instructions** — reusable prompt rules in `.ralphify/instructions/`.

---

## 0.1.2 — 2026-03-09

Quality-of-life improvements for the core loop.

### Added

- `ralph status` command
- `--timeout` / `-t` option
- `--log-dir` / `-l` option
- `--version` / `-V` flag
- ASCII art startup banner

---

## 0.1.0 — 2026-03-09

Initial release.

### Added

- `ralph init` — create `ralph.toml` and `RALPH.md` in your project
- `ralph run` — the core autonomous loop: read prompt, pipe to agent, repeat
- Iteration tracking with exit codes and duration
- `--stop-on-error` / `-s`, `-n`, `--delay` / `-d`
- Auto-detection of project type during `ralph init`
