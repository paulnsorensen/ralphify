Put your AI coding agent in a `while True` loop and let it ship.

Ralphify is a minimal harness for running autonomous AI coding loops, inspired by the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). The idea is simple: pipe a prompt to an AI coding agent, let it do one thing, commit, and repeat. Forever. Until you hit Ctrl+C.

```
while :; do cat RALPH.md | claude -p ; done
```

Ralphify wraps this pattern into a proper tool with config, iteration tracking, and clean shutdown.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install ralphify    # recommended
```

Or if you don't have `uv`:

```bash
pipx install ralphify       # isolated install via pipx
pip install ralphify         # plain pip (use a virtualenv or --user)
```

Any of these gives you the `ralph` command.

## Quickstart

```bash
# In your project directory
ralph init      # Creates ralph.toml + RALPH.md
ralph run       # Starts the loop (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

That's it. Two commands.

### What `ralph init` creates

**`ralph.toml`** — tells ralphify what command to run:

```toml
[agent]
command = "claude"
args = ["-p", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
ralph = "RALPH.md"
```

**`RALPH.md`** — a starter prompt template. This file IS the prompt. It gets piped directly to your agent each iteration. Edit it to fit your project.

### What `ralph run` does

Reads the prompt, pipes it to the agent, waits for it to finish, then does it again. Each iteration gets a fresh context window. Progress lives in the code and in git.

```bash
ralph run          # Run forever
ralph run -n 10    # Run 10 iterations then stop
ralph run docs     # Use a named ralph from .ralphify/ralphs/
```

### What it looks like

```
$ ralph run -n 3 --log-dir ralph_logs

── Iteration 1 ──
✓ Iteration 1 completed (52.3s) → ralph_logs/001_20250115-142301.log
  Checks: 2 passed
    ✓ lint
    ✓ tests

── Iteration 2 ──
✗ Iteration 2 failed with exit code 1 (23.1s)
  Checks: 1 passed, 1 failed
    ✓ lint
    ✗ tests (exit 1)

── Iteration 3 ──
✓ Iteration 3 completed (41.7s) → ralph_logs/003_20250115-143012.log
  Checks: 2 passed
    ✓ lint
    ✓ tests

Done: 3 iteration(s) — 2 succeeded, 1 failed
```

Iteration 2 broke a test. Iteration 3 automatically received the failure output and fixed it — that's the self-healing loop in action.

## The technique

The Ralph Wiggum technique works because:

- **One thing per loop.** The agent picks the most important task, implements it, tests it, and commits. Then the next iteration starts fresh.
- **Fresh context every time.** No context window bloat. Each loop starts clean and reads the current state of the codebase.
- **Progress lives in git.** Code, commits, and a plan file are the only state that persists between iterations. If something goes wrong, `git reset --hard` and run more loops.
- **The prompt is a tuning knob.** When the agent does something dumb, you add a sign. Like telling Ralph not to jump off the slide — you add "SLIDE DOWN, DON'T JUMP" to the prompt.

## Beyond the basic loop

The simple loop works, but ralphify's real power comes from three primitives that live in the `.ralphify/` directory.

### Checks — the self-healing loop

Checks validate the agent's work after each iteration. When one fails, its output automatically feeds into the next iteration so the agent can fix its own mistakes.

```bash
mkdir -p .ralphify/checks/tests
```

Create `.ralphify/checks/tests/CHECK.md`:

```markdown
---
command: uv run pytest -x
timeout: 120
---
Fix all failing tests. Do not skip or delete tests.
```

Now the loop self-corrects:

```
Iteration 1 → Agent adds feature → tests pass ✓ → moves on
Iteration 2 → Agent adds feature → tests fail ✗
Iteration 3 → Agent sees failure output → fixes tests → pass ✓
```

You define what "valid" means. Ralphify feeds failures back automatically.

### Contexts — dynamic data injection

Contexts inject fresh data into the prompt each iteration — git history, test status, anything a shell command can produce.

```bash
mkdir -p .ralphify/contexts/git-log
```

Create `.ralphify/contexts/git-log/CONTEXT.md`:

```markdown
---
command: git log --oneline -10
---
## Recent commits
```

The command runs before each iteration. Use `{{ contexts.git-log }}` in your `RALPH.md` to control where the output appears.

### Ralphs — named task switcher

Keep multiple ralphs for different jobs and switch between them at run time:

```bash
ralph new docs
ralph new refactor
```

Edit `.ralphify/ralphs/docs/RALPH.md` with your documentation-focused prompt, then:

```bash
ralph run docs           # Use the "docs" ralph
ralph run refactor -n 5  # Use "refactor" for 5 iterations
```

## Customizing your ralph

The generated `RALPH.md` is a starting point. A good prompt for autonomous loops typically includes:

- What to work on (specs, plan file, TODO list)
- Constraints — what NOT to do (no placeholders, no skipping tests)
- Process — how to validate and commit

The agent reads this ralph fresh every iteration, so you can edit it while the loop is running. When the agent does something dumb, add a sign to the prompt — the next iteration follows the new rules.
