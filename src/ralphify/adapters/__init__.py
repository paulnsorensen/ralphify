"""Pluggable CLI adapter layer.

Each supported agent CLI (Claude, Codex, Copilot, ...) implements the
:class:`CLIAdapter` protocol in its own module under this package.  The
engine dispatches on :func:`select_adapter` at run time, so adding a new
CLI means writing one file and registering it in :data:`ADAPTERS` — no
edits to the engine, emitter, or subprocess machinery.

Adapters translate the CLI's native output format to a common
:class:`AdapterEvent` stream and advertise capability flags so the core
loop can gracefully degrade when a CLI lacks structured output or hook
injection.  Process lifecycle (spawn, SIGTERM at cap, reap) stays in
``_agent.py``; adapters only observe.

The Protocol, registry, and supporting types live in
:mod:`ralphify.adapters._protocol` so concrete adapter modules can
import them without triggering this package ``__init__`` — which imports
those same concrete adapters to populate the registry.  This package
module just re-exports the public surface and runs the registration.
