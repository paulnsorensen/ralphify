"""Event types and emitter protocol for the run loop.

The run engine emits structured events during execution so that different
frontends can observe progress without coupling to the engine internals.

- **CLI mode** renders events to the terminal via
  :class:`~ralphify._console_emitter.ConsoleEmitter`.
- **UI mode** pushes events through a :class:`QueueEmitter` into the
  FastAPI web layer, which broadcasts them over WebSocket.
- **Tests** use :class:`NullEmitter` to silently discard events.

To add a new event type, add a member to :class:`EventType` and handle it
in both :class:`~ralphify._console_emitter.ConsoleEmitter` (terminal
rendering) and the UI event consumer (WebSocket broadcast).
